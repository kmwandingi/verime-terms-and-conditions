<strong>Verime Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
  By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure, therefore, that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Verime Tech.
</p> <p>
  Verime Tech is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
</p> <p>
  The Verime Namibia app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us to provide our Service. We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By using the Verime Namibia app, you consent to the collection, storage, and processing of your personal data as outlined in our Privacy Policy.
</p> <p>
  It's important to note that when users accept a request and/or fill in a form, they are giving Verime Tech tacit permission to share the information provided with the third party that requested it, as outlined in our Privacy Policy and in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR.

  You should be aware that certain functions of the app will require an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. Verime Tech cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and if you don't have any data allowance left. It's your responsibility to ensure a secure and stable internet connection while using the Verime Namibia app.

Please note that when using the Verime Namibia app outside an area with Wi-Fi, you are subject to the terms and conditions of your mobile network provider. This means that you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data during the connection while accessing the app or other third-party charges. By using the app, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside your home territory (region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the app, we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer to use the app.

While Verime Tech strives to ensure that the app is updated and correct at all times, please note that we rely on third parties to provide information to us for availability in the app. Therefore, Verime Tech accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you may experience as a result of relying solely on the functionality of the app.

At some point, we may release updates for the Verime Namibia app. You must download these updates to continue using the app. We cannot guarantee that we will always update the app to be compatible with all operating system versions or devices. However, by accepting these terms and conditions, you agree to accept updates to the application when they are offered to you. Verime Tech also reserves the right to stop providing the app and terminate its use at any time without prior notice. Upon termination, the rights and licenses granted to you under these terms and conditions will end, and you must stop using the app and, if necessary, delete it from your device.
